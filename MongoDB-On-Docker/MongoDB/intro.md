Welcome to the first scenario. Here you will be 

1. Creating a host based volume for persisting mongo files
2. Launch a pre-built docker image for mongo
3. Check the status of the mongo instance inside the container
4. Stop and remove the conainer

All of this in less than 5 minutes.
Note: This is just to show you how easy and how quick it is to stand up your first MongoDB container.
