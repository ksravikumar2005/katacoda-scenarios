Welcome to the second scenario. Here you will be

1. Clone an existing git repo containing the Dockerfile for building Custom Mongo images
2. Build your first MongoDB image on CentOS 7+
3. Creating a host based volume for persisting mongo files
4. Launch the newly built docker image
5. Check the status of the mongo instance inside the container
6. Stop and remove the conainer

All of this in less than 10 minutes.


Optionally: Push the newly created docker image to your own Docker Registry
